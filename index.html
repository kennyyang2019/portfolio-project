				Meow there! Enoki here, the most adorable ball of fluff you'll ever lay
				eyes on! I may only be 5 months old, but trust me, I've got this whole
				world figured out. Here's a little secret just between us – I used to
				have three siblings, but they were totally cramping my style. So, I
				pulled out my most irresistible "adopt me" face and scored myself the
				purrfect humans. Now I've got an entire kingdom all to myself! My days
				are jam-packed with super important kitty business. First up, my morning
				parkour session – you should see me flying over furniture! Nap time is
				absolutely sacred around here. Oh, and let's not forget my crucial
				mission: keeping my humans wide awake after dark during prime hunting
				hours! Someone's gotta do it, right? I may be small, but my personality?
				Absolutely massive. My humans claim I'm named after some kind of
				mushroom, but have they even looked at me? Do I look like a fungus to
				you? The mystery continues... Life's pretty sweet when you're as
				adorable as moi. So in a nutshell, I have two humans at my beck and
				call, endless toys, and more boxes to sit in than I can count! -Enoki
